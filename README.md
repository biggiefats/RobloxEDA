# Roblox Explanatory Data Analysis

## Overview
An Explanatory Data Analysis project that uses machine learning algorithms to test hypotheses/questions.
This dataset was formed by a combination of **Selenium** and **BeautifulSoup**.

## Questions / Hypotheses

- Games that include a reference to an update in their title will have a **greater** ratio
of current players to total players than games that do not.

- There is a **quadratic** proportion between one of two variables in this dataset.

- Is the **length of a title** an indicator of the **rating of the game above 90%**?

- Are there **common words** used in games that have a **high all-time visits** and a 
  **high favourites** count?

- What games have **disproportionate** like and dislike counts, given their ratio?

- Do the **likes, dislikes and total visits** indicate whether or not a game's 
  **current players is above 10% of the number of favourites** on the game?

- Classify games by how many **unique** letters they have. Do the **general metrics** 
  to a game define the unique letters in the game?
